# Signal Noise Reduction and Analysis Using MATLAB

## Overview
This project focuses on reducing noise in communication signals using digital filtering techniques implemented in MATLAB.

## Objectives
- Generate a clean sinusoidal signal
- Add real-world Gaussian noise
- Apply digital low-pass filtering
- Analyze signals in time and frequency domains
- Evaluate performance using Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)

## Methodology
- Signal generation using sampling principles
- Noise modeling using AWGN
- Butterworth low-pass filter design
- FFT-based frequency domain analysis
- Quantitative evaluation using SNR

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Signal Processing Toolbox

## Results
The filtered signal demonstrates significant noise reduction with improved SNR.
Result plots are included in the `results` folder.

## Applications
